All sensors have internet connectivity through in-home Wi-Fi. All sensors except the smart speaker shared a similar system architecture which comprised a microcontroller, a sensing module, a rechargeable battery, and some electronic components. The micro-controller was Arduino-based.

The sensors were deployed in a simulated apartment called HomeLab in Summer 2021. HomeLab is a ‘home within a lab’ where researchers can invent and test new products to help older people and those with disabilities stay at home longer and more safely. The lab resembles a typical single-storey dwelling with functional plumbing and wiring. Study subjects can occupy the living space and test innovations in a real-life setting, while researchers can observe all studies from an overhead catwalk. HomeLab provides a lab environment for early testing of prototypes and processes before they are deployed in trials in real homes.

The IBM Watson IoT platform was used to receive data from all sensors and connect with other cloud services on the cloud.
